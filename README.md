# Welcome to Virtual Entity Tutorial With Dynamics 365

This is of the four-part series tutorial where I am trying to explain virtual entity in Dynamics 365 CE. The chapters are,

 - [Chapter 1](https://imran-chowdhury.blogspot.com/2019/09/virtual-entity-chapter-1-definition-and.html) - Core concept and definition
 - [Chapter 2](https://imran-chowdhury.blogspot.com/2019/09/virtual-entity-chapter-2-create-custom.html) - Setting up custom data source and custom provider and hands on code
 - [Chapter 3](https://imran-chowdhury.blogspot.com/2019/09/virtual-entity-chapter-3-translating.html) – Introducing searching capability
 - [Chapter 4](https://imran-chowdhury.blogspot.com/2019/09/virtual-entity-chapter-4-pulling-api.html) – Storing the settings for the api.

All the customization used in the tutorial is found on [releases](https://github.com/ImranCodeBug/codebug.countryprovider/releases/tag/1.0.0.0) section of the same Github repo. I have tagged the binaries as pre-release as I have not used the code in any production scenario. Although I am keeping an eye out for any possible bug reported in Github or to my email but please consider all the code as is. In the code I have integrated country Api found in this page along with the description of the each end point. A huge shout out to [ApiLayer](https://rapidapi.com/apilayernet/api/rest-countries-v1/endpoints). A big thanks to [Mark Findlater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-findlater-1428a01/) for reviewing the blog.
